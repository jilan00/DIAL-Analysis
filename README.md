# DIAL-Analysis

Previously (i.e., in the R file) I used the catacode function to examine how the frequency of racial identifications changed when we used the multiple and priority approaches. The data you used was from wave 1 of the DIAL study. Now we have wave 2 of the study and can examine how racial identification may or may not change over time. Thus, in addition to using the multiple and priority approaches, we will also look at the mode approach. Additionally, we have teacher self-report (“T_” variables), student self-report (“ST_”), and teacher reports of students (“TR_”). Start with just the teacher and student self-reports.

 
Ultimately, the goal is to answer the question, “How do teachers and students self-identify their race across the two waves of data?” We want to compare how much the answer changes based on taking the multiple, priority, and mode approaches in the catacode function.
